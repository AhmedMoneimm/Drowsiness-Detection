# Drowsiness Detection While Driving

This project focuses on developing a vision system using PyTorch and YOLOv8 architecture to detect driver drowsiness in real-time. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the system analyzes facial expressions to accurately classify drivers as awake or drowsy. The main objective is to enhance road safety by timely identifying and alerting drivers of potential drowsiness.

## Key Features

- Driver drowsiness detection: The system utilizes facial expression analysis to detect signs of driver drowsiness.
- High accuracy: Leveraging PyTorch and YOLOv8 architecture, the system achieves precise prediction of drivers as awake or drowsy.
- Promotes driver safety: By detecting signs of drowsiness, the system serves as a valuable tool to raise driver awareness and encourage timely rest breaks, reducing the risk of fatigue-related accidents.

## How it Works

1. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to capture and analyze real-time facial expressions of drivers.
2. The trained deep learning model implemented with PyTorch and YOLOv8 architecture accurately classifies drivers as awake or drowsy.
3. If drowsiness is detected, the system triggers timely alerts to draw the driver's attention to prevent potential accidents.
